SRGCREATE EXECUTABLE,../bin/srgcreate.exe,Location of srgcreate executable
SRGMERGE EXECUTABLE,../bin/srgmerge.exe,Location of srgmerge executable - set to Java to use Java gapfilling and merging
DEBUG_OUTPUT,Y,Output debug control
OUTPUT_FORMAT,SMOKE,output files used for SMOKE
OUTPUT_FILE_TYPE,EGrid,"Type of output shapes being generated - RegularGrid, Polygon or EGrid"
OUTPUT_GRID_NAME,EGRID_359X573,This is a grid name for output area.
GRIDDESC,./GRIDDESC.txt,It is the file containing the list of available of grids (needed only for SMOKE surrogates).
OUTPUT_FILE_ELLIPSOID,"+a=6371200.0,+b=6371200.0",Output grid projection ellipsoid for the grid.
OUTPUT_POLY_FILE,../data/egrid_arc.dat,It is the name of a Shapefile in the Shapefile catalog that contains the output shapes (e.g. census tracts) or it is the name of an arcinfo polygon text file with projection description in GRIDDESC
OUTPUT DIRECTORY,../output/egrid,Directory for individual surrogate files
OUTPUT SURROGATE FILE,../output/egrid/srg_total.txt,name and path for the final merged surrogate file output from srgtool
OUTPUT SRGDESC FILE,../output/egrid/SRGDESC.txt,file with surrogate codes and description
OVERWRITE OUTPUT FILES,YES,Users can choose YES to overwrite the individual and total output surrogate ratio files
LOG FILE NAME,srgRun_egrid.log,log file to store all information from running the program
DENOMINATOR_THRESHOLD,0.0005,surrogate ratio is output as comment line with # sign if denominator of surrogate ratio computation is less than the threshold
COMPUTE SURROGATES FROM SHAPEFILES,YES,"It can be YES or NO.  If YES is selected, srgcreate is called to compute surrogates."
MERGE SURROGATES,YES,"It can be YES or NO.  If YES is selected, SurrogateTools.jar is called to merge surrogates."
GAPFILL SURROGATES,YES,"It can be YES or NO.  If YES is selected, SUrrogateTools.jar is called to gapfill surrogates."
