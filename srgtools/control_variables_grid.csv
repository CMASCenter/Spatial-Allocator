LOG FILE NAME,srg_grid.log,log file to store all information from running the program
DENOMINATOR_THRESHOLD,0.0005,surrogate ratio is output as comment line with # sign if denominator of surrogate ratio computation is less than the threshold
COMPUTE SURROGATES FROM SHAPEFILES,YES,"It can be YES or NO.  If YES is selected, srgcreate is called to compute surrogates."
MERGE SURROGATES,YES,"It can be YES or NO.  If YES is selected, merge surrogates."
GAPFILL SURROGATES,YES,"It can be YES or NO.  If YES is selected, gapfill surrogates."
