SURROGATE SPECIFICATION FILE,./surrogate_specification_2002.csv,File containing settings for generating surrogates
SHAPEFILE CATALOG,./shapefile_catalog.csv,Shapefile names and map projection information
SHAPEFILE DIRECTORY,../data/emiss_shp2003/us,Directory containing all shapefiles needed
SURROGATE CODE FILE,./surrogate_codes.csv,List of surrogate codes and names 
SRGCREATE EXECUTABLE,../bin/srgcreate.exe,Location of srgcreate executable
SRGMERGE EXECUTABLE,../bin/srgmerge.exe,Location of srgmerge executable - set to Java to use Java gapfilling and merging
DEBUG_OUTPUT,Y,Output debug control
OUTPUT_FORMAT,SMOKE,output files used for SMOKE
OUTPUT_FILE_TYPE,Polygon,Type of output shapes being generated - RegularGrid or Polygon 
OUTPUT_POLY_FILE,tnnc,It is the name of a Shapefile in the Shapefile catalog that contains the output shapes (e.g. census tracts).
OUTPUT_POLY_ATTR,STFID,It is an ID attribute in the OUTPUT_POLY_FILE shapefile.
OUTPUT DIRECTORY,../output/test/poly,Directory for individual surrogate files
OUTPUT SURROGATE FILE,../output/test/poly/srg_total.txt,name and path for the final merged surrogate file output from srgtool
OUTPUT SRGDESC FILE,../output/test/poly/SRGDESC.txt,file with surrogate codes and description
OVERWRITE OUTPUT FILES,YES,Users can choose YES to overwrite the individual and total output surrogate ratio files
LOG FILE NAME,srgRun_poly.log,log file to store all information from running the program
DENOMINATOR_THRESHOLD,0.0005,surrogate ratio is output as comment line with # sign if denominator of surrogate ratio computation is less than the threshold
COMPUTE SURROGATES FROM SHAPEFILES,YES,"It can be YES or NO.  If YES is selected, srgcreate is called to compute surrogates."
MERGE SURROGATES,YES,"It can be YES or NO.  If YES is selected, SurrogateTools.jar is called to merge surrogates."
GAPFILL SURROGATES,YES,"It can be YES or NO.  If YES is selected, SUrrogateTools.jar is called to gapfill surrogates."
