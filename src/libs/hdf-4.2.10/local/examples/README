                               HDF4 Examples

This directory contains example programs for the installed APIs and scripts to 
compile and run them.  Examples in the c subdirectory are always 
installed, and those in the fortan subdirectory will be installed 
when fortran is enabled.

Running the run-all-ex.sh script in this directory will run the scripts and in 
turn the examples in the subdirectories where examples are installed.  The 
scripts can also be run individually.  The appropriate compile scripts in the 
bin directory for this install will be used by default to compile and link the 
example programs.  Note that h5redeploy must be run if these binaries are 
copied or extracted in a directory other than the one where they were initially 
installed.  Compile scripts from other locations can be used by setting an 
environment variable prefix to the path of the directory containing the bin 
directory with the compile scripts h4cc and h4fc.  For example, export 
prefix=/usr/local/hdf4 to use h4cc and h5fc in /usr/local/hdf4/bin.

Running HDF4 examples built with shared libraries not in system locations may 
result in an error message "...error while loading shared libraries: ...".  
Setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include the directory containing the missing library
should allow the examples to run.
