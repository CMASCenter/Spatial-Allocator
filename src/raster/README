09/30/2015

Update Release Notes for SA 4.2:
	This update release has the following updates:

        Vector Tools:
        (1) Fixed an error in re-gridding the BELD3 data for CMAQ.
        (2) Fixed an error in surroagte computation related to holes in polyogns.

	Raster Tools:
	(1) Updated extraction tools for FEST-C output because of changed format and 
            variable name definitions.

        Surrogate Tools:
        (1) Fixed a bug related with polygon surrogate normaliztion when st+county code is 4 digit.
 	(2) Fixed a bug in surrogate normalization in reading surrogate data lines with leading spaces and no "!" sign.
        (3) Added QA threshold for reporting.
        (4) Updated the surrogate Merging Tool to output QA information on the source surrogates.
        (5) Added leading "0" for one digit state codes in both merging and normalization tools.



1. Set the system:
	(1) Modify ./bin/sa_setup.csh

	(2) Include  sa_setup.csh in your .cshrc

        (3) Troubleshooting for library errors in the SA Raster Tools:
            >Recompile all libraries under src/libs following instructions in the src/libs/README file.
            >Modiy src/raster/Makefile for correct paths.
            >Type "make clean" to clean previous compiled programs.
            >Type "make" to compile the tools.
            >Type "make -B install" or "make install" to install compiled tools.

        (4) Troubleshooting for library errors in the SA Vector Tools:
            >Modiy src/vector/Makefile for correct library paths. Users can use src/vector/libs_32bits
            >Type "make clean" to clean previous compiled programs.
            >Type "make" to compile the tools.
            >Type "make install" to install compiled tools.
          

2. Vector tools are stored in: bin/32bits and sample vector script files are in sa_052014/scripts.  
   Users normally do not need to recompile the Vector Tools as they are statically compiled.
   The Raster Tools often need to be re-compiled as they are not statically built.


3. Important Notes:
   tmp*.* files created under ./raster_script can be deleted after the completion of the run


4. Sample land use and satellite data can be stored in ./data/sat.  See ./data/sat/README for data download.
   Sample Raster Tools running script files in ./raster_scripts:


5. SA Raster Tools for Satellite data and land use data processing:

(1) allocateGOES2WRFGrids.csh -- GOES data processing tool. Modify it based on your inputs.
	Download GOES data and put all data under one directory which is defined in the script.  
	Under this directory, each day is a subdirectory as YYYYMMDD 
	which contains GOES files for that day.  
	Contact: Dr. Arastoo Pour Biazar (biazar@nsstc.uah.edu) at 
	UAH's Earth System Science Center (ESSC) for the GOES data which can be processed by the tool.


(2) allocateMODISL2CloudVars2Grids.csh -- MODIS L2 cloud and aerosol product processing tool. Modify it for your inputs.
	Down load data from the NASA LAADS web site:  http://ladsweb.nascom.nasa.gov/data/search.html

	MODIS Cloud Products:
	Cloud product variables contain 5km and 1km data.  To use this re-gridding tool,
	users have to download two sets data: MOD06_L2 and MOD03 (Level 1 Geolocation 1km) into the input directory.
	for Terra or MYD06_L2 and MYD03 for Aqua in input data directory.

	MODIS Aerosol Products:
	Aerosol products contain variable data at 10km resolution (nadir).  Users have
	to download MOD04 for Terra or MYD04 for Aqua in the input data directory.


(3) allocateOMIL2vars2Grids.csh - OMI L2 aerosol and NO2 product processing tool.  Modify it for your inputs.
	Download data from the NASA mirador site: 
	http://mirador.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/mirador/presentNavigation.pl?tree=project&project=OMI
        Put downloaded data in one directory which is defined in the script file.


(4) allocateOMIvar2Grids.csh - OMI L2G and L3 aerosol and NO3 processing tool.  Modify it for your inputs.
	Download data from the NASA Geonanni web site:
		http://gdata1.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/daac-bin/G3/gui.cgi?instance_id=omi
        The tool is also may also be used process MODIS L3 products (not tested well) from NASA MODIS web site.


(5) NLCD_MODIS_processor.csh - generate WRF grid NLCD and MODIS landuse data.  
	Download NLCD data from: http://www.mrlc.gov/nlcd06_data.php
        Download MODIS tiled data (MCD12Q1) from: https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/modis_products_table

(6) landuseTool_WRFCMAQ_BELD4.csh - generate BELD4 data from 2001 or 2006 NLCD/MODIS and crop tables.  
	Processed crop and tree tables and shapefiles are stored under "data" directory.   
	Download NLCD data from: http://www.mrlc.gov/nlcd06_data.php
        Download MODIS tiled data (MCD12Q1) from: https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/modis_products_table
