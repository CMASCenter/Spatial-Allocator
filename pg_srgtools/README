# Instruction to How to Run PostgreSQL/PostGIS SA Tool
# Created by UNC (11/1/2018)

Notes: This is a beta version, only 2xx, and polygon type of surrogates in 1xx, 3xx, 5xx, and 8xx can be created currently. 

0. Prerequisites
   - Install the Postgres database server and the PostGIS extension. Make sure the Postgres server is running.
      - for Mac, follow instructions https://medium.com/@Umesh_Kafle/postgresql-and-postgis-installation-in-mac-os-87fa98a6814d
   - Create a new database for the surrogates work. This document uses a database named "surrogates" or "NEI2014" by default.
     > From the psql command line, run "CREATE DATABASE surrogates;"
     > Connect to the new database with the command "\c surrogates"
     > Add the PostGIS extension to the new database: "CREATE EXTENSION postgis;"

   - For the surrogates tool to run, you will need to have a database user with all privileges on the new database.
     :The following psql commands create a new user and assign the appropriate priveleges.
     > CREATE USER <username> WITH PASSWORD '<password>';
     > GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE surrogates TO <username>;
     > GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO <username>;

   - Install the Java Runtime Environment (if needed).
   - Install the tcsh package (if needed).
   - Download the Spatial Allocator package.

1. Update "pg_setup.csh" based on your location in your server and then "source" it (create/start the PostgreSQL Database)
   > setenv SA_HOME    /opt/srgtool
   > setenv PGHOME     /usr/bin
   > setenv PGBIN      /usr/bin
   > setenv PGDATA     /opt/srgtool/data

2. Load the output modeling projection:
   - Go to ./util directory
   - Invoke the following command to insert the output projection into your DB. Note: User can use a different number than 900921 if this number is already taken in spatial_ref_sys table in your DB. 

     > "psql -h localhost -d surrogates -U $user -f create_900921.sql"

3. Load modeling grid domain:
   - Update the following settings and variables to load the modeling domain in the PostgreSQL DB using the "generate_modeling_grid.sh" script
     : Update $dbname, $schemaname, $server, $user
     : Add your own modeling domain information (see the example)
   - Invoke "generate_modeling_grid.sh"

4. Load data and multiple weight shape files first and then transform them to the output projection (ex: 900921)
   - Update the following settings and variables in the "load_shapefile_reproject_multi.csh" script
       : Add new weight shape files and/or remove already loaded shape files by commentting out.
       : Set "srid" to the output projection (e.g., 900921)
       : Update $dbname, $schemaname, $server, $user
   - Invoke "load_shapefile_reproject_multi.csh"

5. Create Surrogates
   - Update the following settings in the "control_variables_pg.csv" input file.
     > SRGCREATE EXECUTABLE
     > GRIDDESC  (Note: grid name can't be larger than 16 chars. ) 
     > OUTPUT_GRID_NAME
     > SURROGATE SPECIFICATION FILE
     > SHAPEFILE CATALOG
     > OUTPUT DIRECTORY
     > OUTPUT SRGDESC FILE
     > PGSCRIPT DIRECTORY
     > PG_SERVER
     > PG_USER
     > PGBIN
     > SRID_FINAL
     > DBNAME
     > COMPUTE SURROGATES,YES  (Note: set this to YES to create surrogate)
     > GAPFILL SURROGATES,NO   (Note: set this to NO since Gapfill will be done by another java tool, not by PostgreSQL/PostGIS (PG) SA tool) 

6.  Update the "surrogate_generation_pg.csv" input file to specify which surrogates to be created

7.  Update the "surrogate_specification_pg.csv" input file
    : Note that all identifiers (including column names) that are not double-quoted are folded to lower case in PostgreSQL. 
    : Column names that were created with double-quotes and thereby retained upper-case letters
      ex:  weight_function="moves2014=4", then moves2014 is case sensitive 
           weight_shape=Hpms2016, "Hpms2016" will be recognized as hpms2016

   - Update the following settings:
     > DATA SHAPEFILE ( same name as in shapefile_catalog_pg.csv )
     > DATA ATTRIBUTE ( better use lower case )
     > WEIGHT SHAPEFILE ( same name as in shapefile_catalog_pg.csv )
     > WEIGHT ATTRIBUTE ( better use lower case )
     > WEIGHT FUNCTION  ( better use lower case )
     > FILTER FUNCTION  ( better use lower case )

8.  Update the "run_pg_srgcreate.csh" script
     : Make sure to use the PG SA tool version of Java tool (SurrogateTools-2.1.jar) that came with this PG SA tool package

     > Invoke the "run_pg_srgcreate.csh" run script

9.  Check out the PG SA templates for various types of surrogates (MultyPoly, Point, Line,,,)
    -  Go to the directory "pgscripts"
    -  These templates will be used to generate the internal PG SA run scripts to create surrogates.
   - weight shapefile cut by data(county) shape file table

10. Gap filling
   -  Once the surrogates are created by PG SA Tool, update the "control_variables_pg.csv" input file
      > COMPUTE SURROGATES,NO
      > GAPFILL SURROGATES,YES
   -  Invoke the "run_srgtool_fill.csh" run script

11. Create summary tables
   -  Invoke the "qa_srg.csh" run script
