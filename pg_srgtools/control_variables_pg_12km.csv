DENOMINATOR_THRESHOLD,0.0005,surrogate ratio is output as comment line with # sign if denominator of surrogate ratio computation is less than the threshold
COMPUTE SURROGATES FROM SHAPEFILES,NO, but need in gapfill
COMPUTE SURROGATES,YES,"It can be YES or NO.  If YES is selected, srgcreate is called to compute surrogates."
MERGE SURROGATES,NO,"It can be YES or NO. If YES is selected, merge surrogates."
GAPFILL SURROGATES,NO,"It can be NO or NO. If YES is selected, gapfill surrogates."
