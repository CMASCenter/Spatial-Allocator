# Chapter 2. Installation

The Spatial Allocator is a package of binary executables for Linux. The binaries, source code scripts, and test input data may be downloaded using `git` or as a gzipped tarball from the [CMAS Center](https://www.cmascenter.org/sa-tools/).

## Install with git

Use the following git command on your Linux system to download the latest version of the SA.

`git clone https://github.com/CMASCenter/Spatial-Allocator.git`

## Install from a zip or tar file

You can download a zip archive of the SA installation directly from https://github.com/CMASCenter/Spatial-Allocator.  A gzipped tarball of the SA installation is also available from the [CMAS Center](https://www.cmascenter.org/sa-tools/).  Note that you must be logged in to the CMAS website to download the software.

After downloading one of these files, put the file into a directory on your Linux system and use one of the following commands to install the SA package:
