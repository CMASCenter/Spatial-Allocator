   2) Sample shapefiles for Surrogate Tools
   3) Processed GIS files for EPIC site information generation
   For additional input data, check the EPA site https://www.epa.gov/chief. The Spatial section has data used to create surrogates, and the Biogenic section (https://www.epa.gov/air-emissions-modeling/biogenic-emission-sources) has data used to create SMOKE biogenic-related input files.'
